S1047223 P1 Deliverable

The main goal of this project is to use publicly accessible data for linear regression and decision trees. The data selected for this project is “MTA Subway Hourly Ridership: Beginning February 2022: State of New York” which is accessibly at data.ny.gov/transportation. It is important to download this data in order to run the code provided. 

This code provides data cleaning and preprocessing as well as initial exploration. It then assigns the feature and target variables, encodes the categorical variables and splits the data into testing and training sets. After that the code performs linear regression which results in an MSE, RSE and two linear R2 scores. Then the code performs decision trees. The first decision tree has a max depth of five and the second has a max depth of ten. In both cases, you are provided with a training and testing score. 

In the future, I hope to improve the fit of the data for the training and testing scores. 

To use the code provided, follow the instructions for downloading “MTA Subway Hourly Ridership: Beginning February 2022: State of New York” csv listed above, upload it to your Google drive, then Google Colab. Once in Colab, upload the code and change cell 5 so that wherever you saved the csv is being accessed. In my case it is saved in a folder titled DS 655 which is nested within Colab Notebooks, perhaps a similar file structure will work for you.
